# Stream_Generator_using_LFSR
The code generates pseudo-random bitstream from the input given by the user.The current input in the code is of seven bits and the code can be easily modified to incorporate larger inputs.
It incorporates the use of primitive polynomials which have maximal period and the bitstream repeats after (2^n)-1 iterations.
The pn sequence generated can be used for encryption of plaintext.
